# MusicApp
A music web app that lets you stream songs online!  While the core functionality is live, Iâ€™m currently working on adding features like creating a personal collection of downloaded tracks, and much more. The concept is inspired by Spotify.

Introducing a web-based music player that seamlessly fetches and organizes music directly from your local computer directories! With this app, users can explore their personal music collection, play any song listed, and enjoy a hassle-free listening experienceâ€”all within a simple, intuitive interface.
